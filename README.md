If you know how to run bash, you can run the binary (the file without any extension) by typing `./first-code`. Make sure you use cd (change directory) to be in the correct location. Maybe I'll explain this better in the future.

Example executing the file if you saved the repository in Downloads:
```
cd Downloads/first
./first-code
```
